Hello there!\
This repository holds my final project done during the period of FIN510 Big Data Analytics in Finance course.

* [Property Value Assessment](https://github.com/yschang306/FIN510-Property_Value_Assessment_Challenge/blob/main/FIN510_Final_Project/FIN510_Final%20Project.R)
  * Data pre-processing: dealing with missing value and selecting variables.
  * Model training with five different models: simple linear regression, stepwise regression, Lasso regression with the best lambda value, random forest     with 8 variables randomly sampled at each split and regression tree.
  * Finding the best model with the lowest MSE.
  * Predict the value of each property using the best model, random forest model.
